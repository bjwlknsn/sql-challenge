A research project on employees of the corporation Pewlett Hackard from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files. To conduct this research, the following tasks were performed:
1. Tables were designed to hold the data in CSV files using http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com.

2. The CSV files were imported into a SQL database using PGAdmin.

3. Queries were written to answer the research questions.

### Research Questions
The questions that required answers were as follows:
1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.
